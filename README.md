**Requirement:**
Coding Challenge: NYC Schools
GOAL: Verify candidate can provide a technical solution and follow instructions
REQUIREMENTS:
These requirements are rather high-level and vague. If details are omitted, it is because we will be happy with any of a wide variety of solutions. Don't worry about finding "the" solution. Feel free to be creative with the requirements. Your goal is to impress (but do so with clean code).
Create a native app to provide information on NYC High schools.
	•	Display a list of NYC High Schools. 
	•	Get your data here: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/DOE-High-School-Directory-2017/s3k6-pzi2
	•	Selecting a school should show additional information about the school 
	•	Display all the SAT scores - include Math, Reading and Writing. 
	•	SAT data here: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4
	•	It is up to you to decide what additional information to display
When creating a name for your project, please use the following naming convention:
YYYYMMDD-[First&LastName]-NYCSchools (Example: 20180101-DanielleBordner-NYCSchools)
In order to prevent you from running down rabbit holes that are less important to us, try to prioritize the following:
What is Important
	•	Proper function – requirements met.
	•	Well-constructed, easy-to-follow, commented code (especially comment hacks or workarounds made in the interest of expediency (i.e. // given more time I would prefer to wrap this in a blah blah blah pattern blah blah )).
	•	Proper separation of concerns and best-practice coding patterns.
	•	Defensive code that graciously handles unexpected edge cases.
	•	
What is Less Important
	•	Demonstrating technologies or techniques you are not already familiar with.
Bonus Points!
	•	Unit Tests
	•	Additional functionality – whatever you see fit.

iOS:
	•	 “For applications that include CocoaPods with their project code, please commit the third-party frameworks to your repository (Even though this goes against the CocoaPods general rules).”  OR don’t use any third-party dependency if possible, that will allow app to build and run standalone.
	•	Be sure to use safe area insets.
	•	Make sure your app is compatible with iPhone X.
	•	Use Swift as the primary language. Combination of Swift and Objective would be good to show case your skills in both languages 
Android:
	•	Make sure you are correctly handing any necessary permissions.
	•	Please make sure you are using Java. If you want to demonstrate the use of Kotlin, we'd rather you use a combination of both.
	•	Use Java as the primary language. You can show case your skills in Kotlin if you would like to.
As mentioned, you are not expected to function in a vacuum. Use all the online resources you can find, and please do contact us with questions or for interim feedback if you desire.
